           <li>8 Tbsp unsalted butter melted</li>
           <li>2 Tbsp granulated sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> For the Cheesecake</h3>

            <li>2 lb cream cheese, room temperature (4 packages, 8-oz each)</li>
            <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>5 large eggs, room temperature</li>
            <li> 1/4 cup sour cream</li>
            <li> 1/2 Tbsp vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> For the Strawberry Topping</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 1 lb strawberries, rinsed, hulled and thinly sliced, plus 1/2 lb more to garnish</li>
            <li> 1/3 cup granulated sugar, or more to taste</li>
            <li> 1 Tbsp lemon juice, from 1/2 lemon</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p> 1. Prep: Preheat the oven to 350˚F with a rack in the center of your oven. Line the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan with parchment for an easier release.
            <br>
            2. In a medium bowl, combine graham crackers with sugar then stir in melted butte. Mix until moistened. Press crumbs into your prepared pan, going 3/4 of the way up the sides. Bake in the center of the oven at 350˚F for 8 minutes then cool to room temperature.
            <br> 
            3. Increase the oven to 450˚F. Place 2 sheets of extra-wide heavy-duty foil on the counter. Set the springform pan in the center and fold the foil up the sides of the pan ensuring there are no rips. Fan the foil out slightly at the tops to keep the rim clear for rising.
            <br>
            4. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat cream cheese and 1 cup sugar on medium/high speed for 5 minutes until completely smooth, scraping down the bowl as needed.
            <br> 
            5. Reduce speed to medium and add eggs one at a time, letting them incorporate between each addition and scraping down the bowl as needed.
            <br>
            6. Reduce speed to low and add sour cream and vanilla and mix just until incorporated. Pour batter over the cooled crust.

        <h3> How to Bake Cheesecake in a Water Bath</h3>
        <p> 1. Boil a pot of water (boil more than you think you'll need). Set your foil-wrapped cheesecake pan in a deep roasting pan. Pour hot water around the edges about halfway up the sides of the springform pan.
            <br>
            2. Carefully transfer the cheesecake to the center rack of the oven and bake at 450˚F for 15 minutes then reduce heat to 225˚F and, without opening the door, bake an additional 65-75 minutes or until the center of the cheesecake wobbles slightly when you jolt the pan.
            <br> 
            3. Remove the cheesecake from the oven and let it rest in the roasting pan with water for 45 minutes then transfer the pan to a wire rack to cool completely. Cover and chill in the refrigerator overnight to fully set before slicing.
